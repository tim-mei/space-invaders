# space invaders

## time out (tim mei)

**Objective**   
For my project, I wanted to recreate space invaders. The main objective of Space Invaders is to destroy as many waves of aliens as possible to achieve the highest possible score. Alternatively, if the player loses all their lives or lets the aliens invade the planet, the game ends.  In my version, the game will be played on a 1600x900 window. The playerâ€™s goal is to kill all the aliens on the screen before they invade the planet (indicator line). As the aliens are killed off, more will spawn after a majority on screen die. As the game progresses, the aliens will speed up in the horizontal direction, moving faster and faster. As the aliens hit a set border on each side of the screen, they will drop down, getting closer to the planet.

**Instructions**   
Use the left and right arrow keys to pilot the cannon. Press 'spacebar' to shoot pellets at the aliens.  
q - decreases the number of lives by 1  
w - shifts the alien array down   
e - removes all the aliens   
r - adds 250 points to the counter(s)
